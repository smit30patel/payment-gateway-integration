        <center><p style="font-weight: inherit;">Founded by Jennifer Moorehead in 2003, we are a 501(c )3 non-profit education organization dedicated to promoting science literacy to elementary age children through hands-on programs that provide enrichment in every area of science. In doing so, we are able to further our communities’ efforts to educate our children in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) by providing additional resources for schools, as well as beyond the classroom. </p></center>

        <h3 style="color: #7fa300; font-weight: 600;">How We Got Our Start</h3></center>
        <br>
        <center><p style="font-weight: inherit;">The S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation was formed 19 years ago in order to honor Jennifer “Jupiter Jen” Moorehead’s late husband, and to answer a critical need for quality, inquiry-based science programs for every child. “Jupiter Jen”, founder of Science Explorers, saw that her own children’s elementary school was cutting science instruction time and budgets, and that the students’ proficiency levels in the subject were dropping as a result. She knew from her own experience as a parent how well children learned and enjoyed science if they could learn it ‘hands-on’ and she wanted to bring that type of science education to other elementary grade students.</p>

        <h3 style="color: darkgreen; font-weight:600;">What we aim to accomplish:</h3>
        <br>
    </center>   
        <ul style="font-weight: inherit;">
            <li>Inspire lifelong engagement in science at a critical time in young students lives.</li>
            <li>Encourage students to ask questions, think critically and become problem-solving individuals.</li>
            <li>Provide interactive, hands-on learning opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering & Math that extend and enhance the traditional elementary science curriculum.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with the educational community to strengthen STEM skills for students as future workers in an increasingly STEM-oriented world.</li>
            <li>Create a safe environment for expanding young students comfort with and mastery of the natural world around them.</li>
        </ul>
